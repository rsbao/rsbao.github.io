<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
Hi, I'm Robert! Originally from Maryland, I now find myself in the midst of cornfields studying how to most effectively turn rocks into computers. I graduated from UIUC with a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering in three years and am continuing on to an MS/PhD. I will be advised by [Prof. Rakesh Kumar](https://passat.crhc.illinois.edu/).
